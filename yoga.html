        <p>Yoga has brought profound transformation to my life, and I’m passionate about sharing this vitality and peace with others. After completing my 200-hour training at <span class ="blue-highlight">Yoga Maya </span> in Chelsea in 2024, I’ve embraced the role of a guide, blending my love for movement with a focus on mental health.</p>

        <p>With a background in classical Indian dance and 15 years of Bollywood dancing—three of which were spent competing—I infuse my classes with rhythm and joy. My journey also includes healing my body from the inside out through holistic practices, including mindful movement, nutrition, and gratitude.</p>

        <p>In June, I taught at a South Asian mental health wellness event, at the Chai Spot helping participants release emotions through somatic movement. Earlier this November, I taught a <span class ="blue-highlight">community corporate class at Fabrik </span>, in Tribeca. My Vinyasa flow classes at <span class ="blue-highlight">House of Flow in Brooklyn </span>emphasized connection and fluidity, and I’m excited to teach at <span class ="blue-highlight">Clo Women </span> this November.</p>

        <p>My approach honors our unique experiences, fosters community, and invites playfulness into our practice. Join me as we explore the transformative power of movement and holistic well-being together.</p>
