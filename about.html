                <p>I’m Rhea Dudani, a filmmaker driven by my deep passion for feminism and politics. My heart lies in telling stories that uplift South Asian and female voices, striving to shatter barriers and inspire change.</p>
                <p>My filmmaking journey began back in 2008, when I picked up my mother's camcorder for my directorial debut: a film starring my younger sister and an eclectic cast of household plants, completely narrated by yours truly. Unfortunately, this filmmaking endeavor taped over a slew of important family memories. It's okay, though... our family has gotten over it. It was a whimsical beginning that ignited my passion for storytelling.</p>
                <p>After years of pursuing visual storytelling through photo and video,  I headed to the Tisch School of the Arts, where I earned my B.F.A. in Film and Television. </p>
                <p>Once I graduated, I jumped into the world of production, working as an Associate Producer at Big Mouth Productions, and Hazel Pictures, where I worked on five separate feature documenatries. Then, I continued as an Associate Producer at AKPD Message & Media. There, I crafted political ads for the 2022 Midterm Election, and the 2024 general election, blending my love for storytelling with a splash of activism.</p>
                <p>Now, I’m embracing the freelance life as a producer, director, and writer. I’m on a mission to amplify South Asian and female voices, using film as a playful yet powerful way to spark conversations and challenge perceptions. Join me on this exciting journey—I can’t wait to see what stories we’ll tell next!</p>
